An adage says that when start-ups ask investors for advice they often get offers for money, but when they ask for money they often get advice. Something similar happens when teams look for growth, they often get learning. And when they look for learning they often get growth. When teams are developing their product or scaling their products into an engine of repeatable sales, you often have a very clear idea of how to grow. It's mostly wrong, but there are parts which are vital and it's only by trying that you can separate the wheat from the chaff. From the outside these attempts look similar as very little moves the needle that investors are most interested in: sales, revenues, profits and speeding along their hockey stick curve. But learning is where the good stuff is. Small incremental insights can build a great competitive moat and enable incredible scale with minimal effort. By building unscalably first, you look for learnings and growth follows when it's good and ready.
