Previously I would try to write as long as I could and try to capture as much of a thought as I could. Now I am aiming, badly, at brevity. I will try to write as succinct a description of a thought or a series of thoughts, as I can. I suspect I will mostly fail. My hope is that I will be able to get more writing down on the page and out there more quickly. A tree here, a sapling there, rather than what was an inpenetrable thicket from the outside.
