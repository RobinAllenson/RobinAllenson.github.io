I'm Robin Allenson. My day job is co-founder and CEO of [Lone.biz](http://lone.biz) and [Similar.ai](http://similar.ai), but I'm also an angel investor and advisor. In the past, I founded, ran and then sold InnerBalloons to [Yext](http://yext.com) and before that, I held leadership roles at Truvo and Razorfish. A long time ago, I did a joint honours in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Science at Edinburgh University, when it was still mostly philosophy.
