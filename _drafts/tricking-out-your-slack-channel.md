Tricking out your Slack channel
Case Study: Robin Allenson 
[BACKGROUND & CONTEXT]
> What’s your current position & focus? [CEO of stealth startup, etc…]
I'm Co-founder and CEO of Similar.ai. We are an image-centric deep learning company helping fashion companies by teaching AIs to do the things people do with fashion: finding, recommending and designing.

> How long have you used Slack? 
I first started using Slack about a year ago, a bit before I started Similar.ai.

> What was your first Slack experience? Who or what pulled you in? 
Another founder told me about it and we started using Slack to discuss a project on which we were collaborating.

[HOW SLACK HAS IMPACTED YOUR WORK FLOW]
> How do you use Slack with your team to communicate & collaborate?
We only use email for a small part of what we do, mostly talking to third parties. Within the team, we use Slack. We have a distributed team with people in Asia and across Europe: Hungary, UK and the Netherlands. The whole business has different Slack channels and we (mostly) keep to our channels for those conversations. We do our competitive research, conversations about finding, preparing for and following up on sales conversations; new AI models; building out our universal fashion catalogue (a way of recognising and generating new examples of any type of clothing, bags, glasses, jewellry, hats or shoes); and joking and goofing off. We have a co-working space we use part-time, but really -- Slack is our office.

> What integrations do you use? How do these integrations work together to improve your workflow & save you time?

* We use our Trello integration heavily. We have boards for AI work, sales opportunities, new product ideas, and UI & app work, and they form an organisational memory & information radiator. If Slack is our office, Trello are our whiteboards. Often new ideas come up on a Slack chat and we'll have a conversation about them, then add that conversation to the Trello card. That enables us to keep track of new ideas without getting overly distracting by them.
* We use Zapier to integrate other services into Slack.
* We use Airtable to do surveys and manage the responses. Airtable pings us every time there is a new response and summarises the response.
* We use Rev.com to transcribe our interviews and we get a ping with a link to a Google Doc with the transcription when it's done.
* We use Amplemarket's Fetch so that whenever we get a new sales lead, we get some initial research about them sent to our #sales channel.
* We also get messages whenever someone installs or uninstalls our software, when an interview has been transcribed, whenever an image labeller has added training images with a link to check them, as well as some KPIs we like to track. We might get a few hundred of these in a day.

Tell us more about your bots. What do they do? How’d you spin them up? How have the bots changed & improved over time? What have you learned about programming Slack bots that you can share?
We use Zapier so that if there isn't an existing Slack integration we can still integrate with that service, and to customise more heavily. We also code our own integrations with our apps.

What team roles and activities has this customized setup impacted? In what way? [e.g. you fired your assistant - no longer needed - or you have fewer useless meetings… etc etc]
As co-founders we have less meetings and less email. Of course, there are some things for which we need a face-to-face but we do a lot over Slack. At my last start-up, an assistant was one of the first roles I hired, but with Slack, Calendly (for BD & sales meetings), Pana (for travel), Rev.com (trancription and meeting notes) and Amplemarket (for sales development) that need has all but gone. 

[THREE BEST THINGS ABOUT SLACK INTEGRATIONS]
> What are the three things that you love the most about your Slack setup? What really rings your chimes? What couldn’t you live without?
Our Slack set-up means that it's an octopus with tentacles in all of the things we do. We are at the brain, but there is lots of intelligence in the tentacles too. But actually, the thing I love most about our set-up are core features of Slack:
* Because everything goes in there, having quick and comprehensive search is brilliant.
* Zapier means that business users can tweak, tinker and hack the world in which they live: playing on the same playing field as engineers.
* Solid native clients which work on web, Mac or phone. We used to use Skype and Hipchat and the later flaked out a lot.
* Single channel and multichannel guests and lots of cheap ways of inviting lots of people with whom to collaborate mean that Slack was free for a long time, then cheap to upgrade and a no-brainer when we reached that threshold.

[ONE ANNOYING OR MISSING THING YOU WISH WORKED BETTER]
> If you could improve one thing in your setup, what would it be? 
I think Posts are too basic. I'd like something more like Google Docs, which allows realtime collaboration and editing and allows easier inclusion of pictures. We are an image-centric company, so pictures and talking about pictures is really important. We have lots of different types of users; some end up using Google Docs, some Dropbox, some a PDF, to work around this. The integrations are great, but some things should be native.
I'd love to add recording to (video) calls (and transcribing, like Rev.com, or paraphrasing like Clarke.ai).
