On failure

(Slava Akhmechet's detailed, reflective and brutally honest post-mortem)[http://www.defstartup.org/2017/01/18/why-rethinkdb-failed.html] is worth a long read and thinking over. I doubt I could write something so good. How many start-ups _haven't_ chosen the wrong market and the wrong metrics of what is good at least once? And how many of those never worked that out until it was too late?

At Lone.biz, we struggle with the same things with which Slava struggled. I hope that being cognisant of it helps us.

When I looked back at what worked and didn't work with InnerBalloons, we got a lot of things right. We were able to hire and retain a killer team of smart and passionate people. We had the right basic strategy for the market we were in and we mostly stayed the course even when the going got tough. We built a stable, powerful and extensible platform.

We tested out a lot of different ideas. Too many in fact. That was our top flaw and it wasn't ever 'ours' but just mine: lack of focus. Different ideas had varying degrees of success:

* Few ideas were technological failures: the code ran and it ran well (mostly).
* Many were product failures: the approach we'd taken didn't work well for commercial problem we'd targeted.
* Many more were commercial failures: they were fascinatingly interesting solutions to difficult problems which *few people wanted to spend enough money on*

Commercial failures came in a few types:

* One-off custom consultancy projects for a single client, no Most Favoured Nation clause in sight, but still dedicating an unreasonably large amount of effort to an essentially un-repeatable project.
* Sometimes we'd be able to sell the same platform repeatedly but we'd get one side or the other of the (Number of customers) * (Product revenue) = Total Revenue equation wrong. Not enough customers for our â‚¬1,000 a month product, or pricing our API calls at levels which meant we could never turn a profit.
* A lot of projects were only barely profitable: we'd live to fight another day, but we'd only gain experience.

In hindsight, I think this came to the blessing and the curse which is a reseller channel. We could have looked at building a small scale group of passionate, early adopter, small-to-medium businesses or enterprises and testing out our ideas with them.

However, in 2013 we started building a product which would become a success. At the end of the year, we rolled it out and there were months of slow blocking and tackling by our reseller to get the go-to-market right. Somewhere in the spring of 2014, everything started to line up and sales exploded: doubling each month. Trying to win other reseller business, we started to bump into our big American competitor Yext. And within a very short amount of time, to my immense surprise, I'd sold the company to them.

InnerBalloons was a string of failures, interspersed with occasional successes. Some of those failures were expensive lessons in what not to do, some were cheap pointers to better directions and some of them were just complete wastes of time, money and energy, devoid of learning, except to realise that you can't take this stuff personally. Nevertheless, there seemed a certain inevitability to the positive outcome. But then, perhaps it's just survival bias -- the truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense.

Three things could have helped:
* Choosing the right end users and listening to them more closely about what their real needs were. 
* Not taking the failures or the successes personally
* Having a specific goal for each experiment and learning to time box these
Mostly we didn't do them, because I lacked the skills at the time. Lacking skills is a most pernicious fault because often it means you don't know and don't that you don't know.
