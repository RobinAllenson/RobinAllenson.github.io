On advertising and truth

The web is a hall of mirrors. There is duplicate content, entire duplicate pages, copies of copies of copies, and very little originality. Worse yet in a way, everyone claims to be the original and the best, to be the most complete, the freshest and the most accurate. In reality, each source -- be it a publisher, ecommerce store or marketplace -- has a little fragment of the big picture but never everything.
